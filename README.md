## Data Folders

*The data files in this repo contain the raw MPN and CFU counts and their normalized values by grams of soil (MPN/g and CFU/g). All statistical analyses were performed in R v4.3.0 (R Core Team, 2023). Raw and normalized data counts, R outputs, and plots were compiled into an Excel spreadsheet.*

MPN values were calculated with the Python package ["MicroMPN"](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/micrompn.git).

Note: For R analysis and plotting purposes, thoughout our R scripts and Excel files we referred to data from soil-only microcosms as **"simple"**. Whereas data obtained from soil and synthetic communities was labeled **"complex".**

**1. Folder**: plasmid_retention

 - This folder contains the data corresponding to the assessment of vector retention in *R. solanacearum* in soil lacking antibiotic selection. 
    
    - R_script - "paired_t_test_analysis.txt"
    
    - R_input_file - 'data_simple_complex.csv"
    
    - Excel_spreadsheet - "data_simple_complex.xlsx" (The spreadsheet contains the R output and boxplots.)

    - Excel_spreadsheets - "CFU_simple.xlsx" and "CFU_complex.xlsx" (Raw CFU data counts)
      

**2. Folder**: MicroMPN_soil_only_microcosm

- This folder contains the data corresponding to soil-only microcosms. 

   - 2.1. *Subfolder*: micrompn
   
      - This folder contains the input and output files used with MicroMPN (https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/micrompn.git). The output of MicroMPN includes MPN, MPN adjusted, Jarvis 95%       CI, and a rarity index. Analysis of data was performed in R and both MPN and MPN adjusted values were analyzed. However, the scientific paper only discusses and displays results       for MPN values. Regardless, the conclusions of the paper remained the same. 
    
      - micrompn_input - "limit_detection_T48_Bio_1.csv"
        
      - micrompn_output - "OUTFILE_raw_trim_limit_detection_T48_bio_1.csv"

   - 2.2. *Subfolder*: R_analysis
     
      - This folder contains two files, an R script and an input file. The R script computes a Pearson correlation, a linear regression, a Bland Altman analysis, and Fisher's F-test          using CFU and MPN data. 
     
      - R_script - "backup_R_corr_regre_BA_ftest_bio1_mpn.txt"
         
      - R_input_file - "limitdetection_bio1.csv"
         
  - 2.3. *Subfolder*: Excel_spreadsheet
      
     - This folder contains a single file with all of the plots for soil-only microcosms. Both MPN and MPN adjusted data were analyzed in R.
      
   - 2.4. *Subfolder*: SpectraMax_output_to_column_format
      
     - This folder contains a python script which converts RFU microplate data (output of SpectraMax M3) to a column format. Users can then import the output file into MicroMPN               for MPN calculations.
     
     - input_file_example - "limit_detection_T48_bio_1"   
             
     - python_script - "three_col_updated.py"

        - The python code returns RFU data in column format.
           
     - output_file_example - "limit_detection_T48_bio_1.csv"
